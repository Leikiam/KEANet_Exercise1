 
Project log:


Programming language:
We Started out trying to use C# ASP.net because we wanted to use the html file given, 
but none of us had enough experience with C# ASP.net. This was time consuming, and we used 3,5 hours trying to
figure out the best way to use ASP.net.

We then decided to change and use C# WPF instead. 2 on the team have used WPF on their Computer Science course.
This meant that 1 had to follow along as best as possible.

This change of technology meant that we had to build a WPF application from the html file from scratch.
Lesson learned here: use more time learning frontend technologies!

Unit tests:
We have used xunit for Visual Studio. The tests are based on the description in the assignment.

Jenkins:
No-one from the team has worked with Jenkins or other integration tools before.
And using C# WPF project with jenking, was not that easy to google for other similary projects.

First we got the project on github, so that every team member could work on the project.
https://github.com/losoriol/KEANet_Exercise1.git

We then linked the github repository with jenkins. 
After the first build, we could see our project successfully runned on jenkins.
But from here we could not figure out how to get jenkins to run our tests.
From here we didn't finish in time. 

We are confused how to work with Jenkins properly.

Other problems:

Working with 1 mac computer and 2 windows, also gave some complications. Docker might have helped here.
