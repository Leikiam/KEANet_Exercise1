We Started out trying to use C# ASP.net because we wanted to use the html file, 
but none of us had enough experience with C# ASP.net. 
We changed it to C# WPF.net where we decided to design the front end ourselves.
We have now learned that instead of trying to do something new, 
we should have tried to make it in what we knew from the start.
